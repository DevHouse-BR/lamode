This extension reworks how Magento handles the loading of JavaScript and CSS. It utilises the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/minify/">Minify library</a> developed by Steve Clay and released under a BSD license.  See the attached screen shots for a before / after comparison on my setup.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">If you are running Magento &lt; version 1.4 please use version 1.1.3 of this extension&nbsp; - available via the Releases tab.</span></p>
<h5>Benefits</h5>
<p>* Javascript AND CSS are combined into one file each <br />* compression even without gzip support on your server <br />* Automatic Versioning - every time you update one of your JS/CSS files a new url gets created forcing the customer's browser to request the new version (be sure to update the Magento cache as well) <br />* Minify does its magic to ensure that CSS images are properly served no matter what package/interface/skin you are using.</p>
<h5>Current Requirements / Caveats</h5>
<p>* needs mod_rewrite enabled / .htaccess support <br />* Installation of CANONICAL URLs by Yoast breaks this extension. A work-around is posted <a href="http://bit.ly/TdHzw">here</a>.<br />* Installation of MXPERTS JQUERY BASE breaks this extension. Tips are posted <a href="http://bit.ly/dvpWSE">here</a>.</p>
<h5>Installation Speedster 2.0</h5>
<p>1.) After installing this extension via Magento Connect make sure that  /lib/minify/m.php is executable (permissions like 755 on the file itself  and the containing folder should work) and /var/minifycache is  writeable.</p>
<h5>Installation Speedster 1.0 - 1.2</h5>
<p>1.) Add the following to your .htaccess <br /> ############################################ <br />## Compress, Combine and Cache Javascript/CSS     <br />RewriteRule ^(index.php/)?minify/([^/]+)(/.*.(js|css))$ lib/minify/m.php?f=$3&amp;d=$2</p>
<p>Directly underneath the Rewrite Base Rule and the workaround for HTTP authorization rule.</p>
<p>2.) After installing this extension via Magento Connect make sure that /lib/minify/m.php is executable (permissions like 755 on the file itself and the containing folder should work) and /var/minifycache is writeable.</p>
<p>If you are running a multi store set up please follow these <a href="http://www.crucialwebhost.com/blog/how-to-setup-multiple-magento-stores/#addon-domain-method">instructions </a>.  Additionally add a symlink to the lib folder.  Please note the above  instructions apply to FOOMAN_Speedster 0.7.0 and above and are slightly  different to previous versions.</p>
<h5>Installation Speedster cont. (All versions)</h5>
<p>Minifying JS and CSS takes a while to compute (~20seconds on my machine). This only needs to be done once per JS/CSS combination and is then written to a cache. To make sure the cache gets filled up simply browse your store and your customers should have a faster experience than before.</p>
<p>Advanced: For installation on a non-Standard Linux installation check out the <a href="http://bit.ly/cmrHLW">ISAPI2</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/9ZzOkh">Nginx</a> threads.</p>
<p>For users of versions 0.7.0 - 0.7.6 please note that editing  /app/design/frontend/YOURINTERFACE/YOURTHEME/layout/page.xml is not needed any more. Please change it back to the original validation.js instead of validation-4min.js</p>
<h5>Troubleshooting</h5>
<p>Please review all the steps listed in this <a href="http://bit.ly/cF1ZSJ">thread</a>. It has the most common errors with solutions listed - when posting any questions please include the output of the 4 steps listed.  Don't disable the output of Fooman_Speedster under Configuration &gt; Advanced - it will make your site unusable.

Additional support can be obtained through our <a href="http://store.fooman.co.nz/extensions/">website</a>.</p>
