<p>This extension provides complete control of SMTP server settings for  Magento. You can specify authentication methods from None, Login, Plain  or CRAM-MD5. You can choose to secure the connection with SSL or TLS, or  disable secure connections completely. The host and port are  configurable.  The extension includes a self test option, which lets you  verify your settings are correct and it works with Magento Newsletters,  two features you may not find in other, older, SMTP extensions.</p>
<p>This extension now combines the Google Apps Email and Gmail sending capability of my other extension. This will be the combined free Magento email extension going forward and all bug fixing and improvements will happen on this extension. If you have any feedback or suggestions, let me know over at my <a href="http://aschroder.com">Magento developer blog</a> - it's also the place to read about how the extension works and any new features that get added.</p>
<p>This extension now (as of 1.0.2) also includes easy to use email sending capability via <a href="../../../extension/1326/aschroder.com-google-apps-email-gmail">Google Apps and Gmail. This</a> allows you to easily send email using Gmail or Google Apps without needing to worry about TLS, SSL or which port to connect to!</p>
<p>if you have any questions, feedback or feature requests, please let me know over at aschroder.com.</p>";s:1:"r";a:1:{s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:10:"xlink:href";s:44:"/Chiara_PEAR_Server_REST/r/ASchroder_SMTPPro";}}}
